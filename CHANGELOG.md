### Version 2.0 (?)

Changes:
- Refactored utility folder structure and code (`Common/*`)
- Refactored vector folder structure and code (`Vector/*`)
- Refactored matrix folder structure and code (`Matrix/*`)
- Refactored quaternion folder structure and code (`Quaternion/*`)
- Refactored geometry header and code (`Geometry/*`)
- `Vector`s:
	- Memory representation:
		- Removed undefined behavior due to swizzle unions
		- Named accessors (i.e. `.x`) are now `Swizzle`s instead of `T&`
	- CTAD for `Vector` constructors
	- Better support for heterogeneous types (i.e. adding vector of `double` plus vector of `float`)
	- Better support and testing for `std::complex`
	- Functions:
		- `IsNullvector`: removed due to questionable meaning / use-cases
		- `IsNormalized`: removed due to questionable meaning / use-cases
		- `SafeNormalize`: renamed to `NormalizePrecise`
		- Homogeneous downcast now performs perspective division
		- Added several new functions
- `Matrix`es:
	- Removed submatrices
	- Added accessors for rows and columns
	- Better support for heterogeneous types (i.e. adding matrix of `double` plus matrix of `float`)
	- Better support and testing for `std::complex`
	- Matrix casts:
		- Constructors now handle more casts
		- Casts are now utility functions mainly for internal use
	- Functions:
		- Added several new functions
- `Quaternion`s:
	- Memory representation:
		- New Layout template param to specify sijk or ijks
		- Removed undefined behavior due to swizzle unions
		- Named accessors (i.e. `.x`) are now `Swizzle`s instead of `T&`
	- Better support for heterogeneous types (i.e. adding quaternion of `double` plus quaternion of `float`)
	- Functions:
		- Deprecated `ScalarPart` and `VectorPart`:
			- Migrate to the new .scalar and .vector swizzlers instead
		- Removed converion operator to Vector<3>: questionable meaning / use-cases (use q.vector instead)
		- Renamed `Conjugate` to `Conj` (in line with STL)
		- Fixed `Inverse` (q^-1) working only for unit quaternions
- Transforms:
	- Minimal changes to interface
	- New transforms:
		- Random, general shear
	- Now also applicable to vectors: zero, random
- Geometry:
	- Complete overhaul of intersections
		- All intersections now return `std::optional<Vector>` for the intersection point
	- Only small changes to objects
- Decompositions:
	- QR: 
		- Added LQ to support wide matrices
	- SVD: unchanged
	- LU/LUP: unchanged
	- All decompositions have a uniform interface:
		- Solve: solve system of equations / least squares if applicable
		- Inverse: compute matrix inverse / pseudoinverse if applicable
