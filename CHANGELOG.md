### Version 2.0 (?)

Changes:
- Refactored utility folder structure and code (`Common/*`)
- Refactored vector folder structure and code (`Vector/*`)
- Refactored vector folder structure and code (`Matrix/*`)
- Refactored vector folder structure and code (`Quaternion/*`)
- `Vector`s:
	- Memory representation:
		- Removed undefined behavior due to swizzle unions
		- Named accessors (i.e. `.x`) are now `Swizzle`s instead of `T&`
	- CTAD for `Vector` constructors
	- Better support for heterogeneous types (i.e. adding vector of `double` plus vector of `float`)
	- Better support and testing for `std::complex`
	- Functions:
		- `IsNullvector`: removed due to questionable meaning / use-cases
		- `IsNormalized`: removed due to questionable meaning / use-cases
		- `SafeNormalize`: renamed to `NormalizePrecise`
		- Homogeneous downcast now performs perspective division
		- Added several new functions
- `Matrix`es:
	- Removed submatrices
		- Added accessors for rows and columns
	- Better support for heterogeneous types (i.e. adding vector of `double` plus vector of `float`)
	- Better support and testing for `std::complex`
	- Matrix cast: TODO
	- Functions:
		- Added several new functions
- `Quaternion`s:
	- Memory representation:
		- New Layout template param to specify sijk or ijks
		- Removed undefined behavior due to swizzle unions
		- Named accessors (i.e. `.x`) are now `Swizzle`s instead of `T&`
	- Functions:
		- Deprecated `ScalarPart` and `VectorPart`:
			- Migrate to the new .scalar and .vector swizzlers instead
		- Removed converion operator to Vector<3>: questionable meaning / use-cases (use q.vector instead)
