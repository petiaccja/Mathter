Prerequisites for building:
- Windows 10 / 11
- Python 3.10 (for conan only)
- [conan](https://conan.io/downloads) 2.3.0 (or later/similar)
- CMake 3.30 (or later/similar)
- Visual Studio 17.10.5 (or similar)
- MSVC 19.40.33813 (or similar)

Build sequence:
- Open VS x64 Native Tools CMD or PowerShell
- `cd Mathter`
- `conan install . --build=missing -pr:h ./.github/build_profiles/msvc17d -pr:b ./.github/build_profiles/msvc17d` -- this installs the dependencies (Catch2, XSimd)
- Go to VS and open the folder as a CMake project
- Select configuration `conan-msvc-17-debug` (VS must pick up the CMake presets generated by conan, the default Debug/Release won't work)
- Project | Configure Cache
- Build | Build All

Repro sequence:
- This is a bit non-deterministic
- Try to edit the code:
	- I got the YAML by editing `include/Mathter/Decompositions/DecomposeSVD.hpp` & `test/Decompositions/TestSVD.cpp`
	- Likely most other files work as well
	- For example, duplicate and rename tests, add random code like `printf`s, `static_cast<void>`s, or just call any routine from the library itself
